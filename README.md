# Census-Map


The Census Map provides an intuitive, user-friendly means to both compare demographic and economic data by zip code by searching for an address or providing their current location. This facilitates the process of finding information with a web browser by having a side by side visualization with a Google map and corresponding census provided by the American Community Survey all within your Android device. 

Future updates will improve any necessary functionality and design specs, more options to filter search results by geography and ability to compare with previous surveys conducted over time.
